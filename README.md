Functional Programming using Scala Tutorial 9
1. 1. Implement a Data Structure for Rational Number and create a method neg
to class Rational that is used like this:
x.neg // evaluates to -x
2. Create a method sub to subtract two rational numbers and find an answer xy-z where
x=3/4, y=5/8, z=2/7.
3. Implement a Data Structure for Account and create a method transfer which
transfers the money from this account to a given account.
Basic functions: Deposit, Withdraw, Transfer
4. A Bank is defined as a List of Accounts. So, implement the following
functions:
4.1 List of Accounts with negative balances
4.2 Calculate the sum of all account balances
4.3 Calculate the final balances of all accounts after applying the interest
function as follows:
If balance is positive, deposit interest is .05 and if
balance is negative, overdraft interest is .1
